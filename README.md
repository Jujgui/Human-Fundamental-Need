# Human-Fundamental-Need
Use of NLP to understand to make link between satisfiers of human fundamental needs

Participants of workshop highlight what they don't like in the society in the first phase et highlight what they want for a better word in a second phase.
Due to of the number of satisfiers and my objective to be objective, I use an NLP from spacy to highlight the recurring themes most talked about by participants.
